  <br>
  <p class="small-text">
    Hi, I'm Audrey Huvaya, I am a front-end developer and a creative with a background in finance and reinsurance accounting (over 8 years to be exact).  I am passionate about creating engaging content and writing code that is both functional and beautiful. 
    <br>
    <br>
    My background lends a unique and analytical approach to solving client-side challenges.
    As a strategic thinker, a team player with excellent communication and interpersonal skills, I am interested in transitioning to a tech role in the insurance and financial services sectors. 
    I believe my background in finance, reinsurance accounting, financial reporting, and risk management, combined with my proficiency in languages such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Python, make me an ideal candidate for this transition.
    <br>
    <br>
    In my previous roles, I have managed complex accounting processes and led teams to achieve exceptional results. 
    I am also a problem solver and go-getter, always seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow my skills and expertise.
    <br>
    <br>
    In my free time, I enjoy writing, creating content, and travelling.
    I am passionate about continuous learning and professional development.
    <br>
    <br>
    
    If you're interested in working together or just want to say hi, feel free to reach out to me ðŸ‘‡.
